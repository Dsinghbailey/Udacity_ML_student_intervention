    "**ANSWER:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the performance of the models and the nature of our problem, I believe SVM would be the proper model choice based on performance. Its accuracy is consistently high and it is inexpensive as long as we don't require probabilities. The Naive Bayes is a decent classifier but its accuracy is consistenty lower than the SV, especially as the datasize shrinks. The continuous nature of the model features means that the SVM makes more logical sense than decision tree. Though the decision tree has a higher F score on the training size of 300, I believe that robustness of the SVM's results and the fact that it has no parameters yet make it the better choice.\n",
    "Even though the SVM is not cheap compared with the other 2 models the cost of this project will be low as we are only looking at one school district. I believe in this case we should value performance over relative cost as we are realistically talking about a very small amount of money. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: In my decisions tree example I specified a max depth of 5 in order to make a more informed decision on the viabiliity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An SVM first transforms the data of the model into a number of dimensions specified by the user. It does this in order to be able to apply functions to nonlinearly-sperable data. This is performed using the kernel trick. Once the kernel function has been applied the SVM fits itself to the data by minimizing the length of the weights vector or ||w||.. This minimization is essentially equivalent to maximizing the margin and reducing error.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the layperson this means that we look at the data and we draw classification lines that maximize the distance from the lines to the points. If the data cannot be separated by lines we transform it until we can see a way to classify the data using lines. THis transformation is done using a class of functions called kernels. \n",
